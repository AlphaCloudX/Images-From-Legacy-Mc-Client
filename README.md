# Minecraft Custom Client Showcase

This repository contains a selection of media showcasing a **custom Minecraft cheating client** developed between late 2016 and 2019. The client includes visual enhancements, in-game modifications, and automated features.

Unfortunately, several iterations have been lost to time, but these mostly expanded on modernizing the main menu with repositioning menu buttons, using OpenGL to draw custom shapes and RGB-themed chat colour through a command. These were worked on around 2021.

This was the first major project that got me into coding.
