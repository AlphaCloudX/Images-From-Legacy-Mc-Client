# Minecraft Custom Client Showcase

This repository contains a selection of media showcasing a **custom Minecraft cheating client** developed between late 2016 and 2019. The client includes visual enhancements, in-game modifications, and automated features.

Several iterations have been lost over time, but these mostly expanded on modernizing the main menu with repositioned buttons, OpenGL custom shapes, and RGB-themed chat colors. These updates were worked on around 2021.

This was the first major project that got me into coding.

## Transition to Python & Deep Learning

### Object Detection & Aim Assist (2022)

**Description:** Showcases a fully external cheat using deep learning for aim assistance. The original Minecraft client I created is visible in the bottom right corner, running on a duplicate account. This marks my transition into Python and computer vision-based automation.

## Historical Context
- Features were developed **from late 2016 through summer 2019**.  
- The speed modifications were last tested in summer 2019.  
- Images and videos showcase the client’s evolution and capabilities.  
- Around 2020, I shifted focus from Minecraft cheats to Python automation projects.
